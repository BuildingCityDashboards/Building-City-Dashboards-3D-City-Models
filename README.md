# Building-City-Dashboards-3D-City-Models
This is a repository of 3D city models for Dublin and Cork created by the Building City Dashboards project at the National Centre for Geocomputation, Maynooth University. 

The repository consists of 
  - a master model that represents a 28 sq km area (7km * 4km) at 1:2000
  - a set of 1 sq km tiled subdivisions of the master model.

All model files are in OBJ format and are derived data created using 2019 Prime 2, Digital Terrain Model, and LIDAR data supplied by the project partner, Ordnance Survey Ireland, manually updated to include new buildings by ground truthing against 2019 Google Earth.
